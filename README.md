# CUMCM-Resources

Welcome to our dedicated space for the China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) preparation. This repository is a special compilation of our custom-made materials crafted throughout our preparation phase for the CUMCM. Each resource available here is a product of our collective effort and commitment.

Our team is composed of:

- Xuhang Ye, who leads our group with the combined responsibilities of captain and programmer.
- Yuxi Qin, our modeling expert, who brings complex theoretical concepts into practical application.
- Yuqiang Zhu, our wordsmith, tasked with the eloquent expression of our methodologies and results.

The purpose behind assembling and sharing this repository is to provide a thorough toolkit for those embarking on their journey to tackle the challenges presented by the CUMCM. We have poured our insights, strategies, and understanding into creating a range of materials—from detailed study guides to practice problems—that reflect our dedication and the breadth of our preparatory work.

It's our hope that this collection not only stands as a record of our own endeavors but also as a valuable asset to peers navigating the complexities of mathematical modeling competitions.
